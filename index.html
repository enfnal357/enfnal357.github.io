		<h2>These are the cousres that I am taking in Fall 2020  </h2>
		<h5> I am undergraduate student in University of Georgia. In this semester (Fall 2020), I am senior in Geography major. Since my academic year is almost over, I selected other subjects that I wanted to learn besides my major. Therefore, the selected subjects are Computer Science 1100, Computer Science 1300, Chinese 1001, and Horticulture 2000E. Below,  there are course descriptions for each subject. They are not only will these be helpful for those interested in those classes in the future, but they will also help later when reflecting on what I learned in those classes. Specific course descriptions can be found by clicking on the links in each title located below the table. Also, you can see the detail descriptions about HORT 2000E and CSCI 1100 (those are does not have link) by clicking "Exception".
